# Building Summary Statistics Tables with `modelsummary` and `gtsummary`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`modelsummary` and `gtsummary` are two excellent r packages to build summary statistics. However, their syntax might not be fully intituitive if you are comming from Stata. Here are a couple of examples using these two packages.

First, let's load the following packages and load our data:

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
library(modelsummary)
library(haven)

census <- read_dta("http://www.stata-press.com/data/r9/census.dta") %>%
  # Create dummy treatment
  mutate(
    rand = runif(n()),
    treatment = as.numeric(rand > 0.5)
  )
```

I'm using the census stata dta file for those who are familiar with this Stata dataset.

## Model Summary

When it comes to model summary, we have two approaches: (1) a rapid data summary, and (2) a more elaborated one. For the former, we use the `datasummary_skim()` function as follows:

```{r skim, warning=FALSE}
datasummary_skim(census)
```

If we want to select only a few variables, we could past a variables vector to the `select` function or create a new object with only the variables we need.

```{r skim2, warning=FALSE}
census %>%
  select(pop, death, marriage, divorce) %>%
  datasummary_skim()
```

In addition, we can let the function knows if we would like to have only summary statistics for those variables that are either numeric or categorical, for example:

```{r skim3, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
datasummary_skim(census, type = "numeric")
```

If we would like to have only the mean, sd, min, max instead of all the statistics that are presented using `datasummary_skim` we can use a 2-sided formula.

```{r datasumm}
build <- pop + death + marriage + divorce ~ N + Mean + SD + Median + Min + Max 

## Without labels

datasummary(
  build,
  data = census
) 
```

In the case of variables labels, we will need to modify those variables names.

```{r datasum}

## With labels

build <- `Population` + `Number of deaths` + `Number of marriages` + `Number of divorces` ~ N + Mean + SD + Median + Min + Max 

datasummary(
  build,
  data = census %>% 
    rename(`Population` = pop, `Number of deaths` = death, `Number of marriages` = marriage, `Number of divorces` = divorce)
) 
```

Finally, we can use the `output` argument to export our table to a several file formats.

```{r output, warning=FALSE}
build <- pop + death + marriage + divorce ~ N + Mean + SD + Median + Min + Max 

datasummary(
  build,
  data = census,
  output = "latex"
) 
```

In the case of latex, your output would like this and you can use the `\input` command in your latex document to add your table to your reports or working papers:

```
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lrrrrrr}
\toprule
  & N & Mean & SD & Median & Min & Max\\
\midrule
pop & 50 & \num{4518149.44} & \num{4715037.75} & \num{3066433.00} & \num{401851.00} & \num{23667902.00}\\
death & 50 & \num{39474.26} & \num{41742.35} & \num{26176.50} & \num{1604.00} & \num{186428.00}\\
marriage & 50 & \num{47701.40} & \num{45130.42} & \num{36279.00} & \num{4437.00} & \num{210864.00}\\
divorce & 50 & \num{23679.44} & \num{25094.01} & \num{17112.50} & \num{2142.00} & \num{133541.00}\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

## GT Summary

`gtsummary` is another package that can be used for basic and complex summary statistics. Its syntax follows the `gt` family. For a basic summary statistics table, we can use the `tbl_summary()` function as follows:


```{r gt1, include = TRUE}
vars <- c("pop", "death", "marriage", "divorce")

tab1 <- census %>% 
  select(all_of(vars)) %>% 
  tbl_summary()
```

```{r gt1-save, include = FALSE}
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tab1), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README_files/figure-gfm/gt1-save-1.png")
```

By treatment variable:

```{r gt2, include = TRUE}
tab2 <- census %>%
  select(all_of(vars), treatment) %>%
  tbl_summary(by = treatment) %>%
  add_p()
```

```{r gt2-save, include = FALSE}
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tab2), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README_files/figure-gfm/gt2-save-1.png")
```

Given that we would like to have a more econ-paper type of descriptive statistics, we can pass the columns we would like to have in a vectorized way. 


```{r gt3, include = TRUE}
cols <- c(N = "{N_nonmiss}", Mean = "{mean} ({sd})", Median = "{median}", Min = "{min}", Max = "{max}")
tab3 <- cols %>% 
  # we would go through each of these columns
  imap(
    ~ census %>% 
      # and select the variables we need in our table
      select(all_of(vars)) %>% 
      tbl_summary(
        statistic = all_continuous() ~ .x
      ) %>% 
      # We will modify the title of cols headers
      modify_header(stat_0 ~ str_glue("{.y}"), label ~ "Variables") 
  ) %>% 
  # and merge every single of the columns into one single table
  tbl_merge() %>% 
  # remove spanning headers and footnote
  modify_spanning_header(everything() ~ NA) %>%
  modify_footnote(everything() ~ NA) 
```

```{r gt3-save, include = FALSE}
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tab2), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("README_files/figure-gfm/gt3-save-1.png")
```

And, finally, we can use the `as_kable_extra` function to export our table to latex. The full example is here below:

```{r gt4}
tab3 %>%
  as_kable_extra(
    format = "latex", 
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = ""
  )
```

That gives you the following latex code:

```
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
Variables & N & Mean & Median & Min & Max\\
\midrule
Population & 50 & 4,518,149 (4,715,038) & 3,066,433 & 401,851 & 23,667,902\\
Number of deaths & 50 & 39,474 (41,742) & 26,176 & 1,604 & 186,428\\
Number of marriages & 50 & 47,701 (45,130) & 36,279 & 4,437 & 210,864\\
Number of divorces & 50 & 23,679 (25,094) & 17,112 & 2,142 & 133,541\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
```
